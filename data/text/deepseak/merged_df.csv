How has OpenAI contributed to advancements in reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent research?,"[""Introduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. ## Text We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it.

Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function.

Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags.

By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.

Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.

For each question, we sample 16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero DeepSeek-R1-Zero attains robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the models ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zeros performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks. ## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. As depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improvement. ### Page Number 7 ## Figure Description ### Title DeepSeek-R1-Zero average length per response during training ### Graph Details - **X-Axis**: Labeled as ""Steps,"" ranging from 0 to 9000. - **Y-Axis**: Labeled as ""Average length per response,"" ranging from 0 to 12000. ### Data Representation - The graph shows a line plot with a blue line representing the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero over the training steps. - The line exhibits an upward trend, indicating that the average response length increases as the']","DeepSeek-R1-Zero employs a rule-based reward system that consists of two primary types of rewards: accuracy rewards and format rewards.

How does reinforcement learning (RL) enhance reasoning capabilities in DeepSeek-R1?,"['DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.']","Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances reasoning capabilities in DeepSeek-R1 by applying a large-scale training process that focuses on reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning.

Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly.

For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.']","The incorporation of Chains of Thought (CoT) data enhances the reasoning capabilities of the DeepSeek-R1 model by providing a structured approach to fine-tuning the model as the initial reinforcement learning actor.

Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

What are the evaluation results reported for AIME 2024?,"['Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness. ## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board.

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering.

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board.

Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32B-Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. ## Discussion ### 4.1. Distillation vs. Reinforcement Learning In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-Rl, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale ## Page Number 14 # Pages 15 and 16 ## Table: Comparison']","In the context of education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3.

How does the performance of OpenAI-01-1217 compare to that of DeepSeek-R1 in terms of reasoning capabilities across various tasks?,"['of Distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCodeBench</th> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>cons@64</td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>pass@1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.6</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B</td> <td>47.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>91.6</td> <td>55.0</td> <td>40.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>72.6</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>94.3</td> <td>62.1</td> <td>57.2</td> </tr> </table> **Table 6**: Comparison of distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks. ## Text RL training, achieves performance on par with QwQ-32B-Preview. However, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an... ## Page Number 15 ## Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate dependency evaluation within the RL process to enhance efficiency.']","OpenAI-01-1217 achieves performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 across a range of tasks.

DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate dependency evaluation within the RL process to enhance efficiency.']","The QwQ-32B-Preview model achieves the following performance metrics on reasoning-related benchmarks: 50.0 pass@1 and 60.0 cons@64 on AIME 2024, 90.6 pass@1 on MATH-500, 54.5 pass@1 on GPQA Diamond, and 41.9 pass@1 on LiveCodeBench.

However, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process.

What are the evaluation results of DeepSeek-R1 on MMLU and how do they compare to DeepSeek-V3?,"['<1-hop>\n\nUltimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness. ## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32B-Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. ## Discussion ### 4.1. Distillation vs. Reinforcement Learning In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-Rl, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale ## Page Number 14 # Pages 15 and 16 ## Table: Comparison']","DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance on the MMLU benchmark compared to DeepSeek-V3.

Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board.

Distillation vs. Reinforcement Learning In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-Rl, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale ## Page Number 14 # Pages 15 and 16 ## Table: Comparison']","DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance on the MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks compared to DeepSeek-V3.

Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training.

Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.

User: **prompt**. Assistant: ## Table 1 | Template for DeepSeek-R1-Zero *prompt* will be replaced with the specific reasoning question during training. ## 2.2.2. Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biasessuch as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategiesto ensure that we can accurately observe the models natural progression during the RL process. ## 2.2.4.

Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.

User: **prompt**. Assistant: ## Table 1 | Template for DeepSeek-R1-Zero *prompt* will be replaced with the specific reasoning question during training. ## 2.2.2. Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biasessuch as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategiesto ensure that we can accurately observe the models natural progression during the RL process. ## 2.2.4.

This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL algorithm in optimizing the models performance over time.

For each question, we sample 16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero DeepSeek-R1-Zero attains robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the models ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zeros performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks. ## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.

How does DeepSeek-R1 improve reasoning capabilities compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero using cold start data?,"[""<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. ## Text We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. ## Page Number 3 ##"", '<2-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.']","DeepSeek-R1 improves reasoning capabilities compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero by incorporating a small amount of high-quality cold start data during its training process.

Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. ## Text We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. ## Page Number 3 ##"", '<2-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.']","The incorporation of cold-start data in the training of DeepSeek-R1 significantly improves its reasoning capabilities compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero by providing a stable initial phase for reinforcement learning (RL).

How does the incorporation of cold-start data in DeepSeek-R1 improve the reasoning capabilities of the DeepSeek-V3-Base model compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero?,"[""<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing.

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin.

However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.

What advancements in reasoning capabilities were achieved with the DeepSeek-V3-Base model and how does DeepSeek-R1 compare to OpenAI's o1 series models in terms of performance on reasoning benchmarks?,"[""<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. ## Text We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. ## Page Number 3 ##"", '<2-hop>\n\nV3: 71.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 68.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 78.0 - DeepSeek R1: 79.0 - **ArenaHard (GPT-4-1106)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 85.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 85.0 - DeepSeek V3: 84.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 80.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 90.0 - DeepSeek R1: 91.0 #### Code Benchmarks - **LiveCodeBench (Pass@1-COT)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 - **Codeforces (Percentile)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **Codeforces (Rating)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **SWE Verified (Resolved)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 40.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 40.8 - DeepSeek V3: 40.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 38.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 50.0 - DeepSeek R1: 51.0 - **Aider-Polyglot (Acc.)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 #### Math Benchmarks - **AIME 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 16.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 16.0 - DeepSeek V3: 15.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 14.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 20.0 - DeepSeek R1: 21.0 - **MATH 500 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 23.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 23.3 - DeepSeek V3: 23.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 21.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 28.0 - DeepSeek R1: 29.0 - **CNMO 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 13.1 - GPT-4o 0513: 13.1 - DeepSeek V3: 12.8 - OpenAI o1-mini: 12.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 16.0 - DeepSeek R1: 17.0 #### Chinese Benchmarks - **CLUEWSC (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 75.6 - GPT-4o 0513: 75.6 - DeepSeek V3: 75.3 - OpenAI o1-mini: 72.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 80.0 - DeepSeek R1: 81.0 - **C-Eval (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 76.7 - GPT-4o 0513: 76.7 - DeepSeek V3: 76.4 - OpenAI o1-mini: 73.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 81.0 - DeepSeek R1: 82.0 - **C-SimpleQA (Correct)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 55.4 - GPT-4o 0513: 55.4 - DeepSeek V3: 55.1 - OpenAI o1-mini: 52.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 68.0 - DeepSeek R1: 63.7 ## Document Analysis For education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3. This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board.

Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. ## Page Number 3 ##"", '<2-hop>\n\nV3: 71.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 68.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 78.0 - DeepSeek R1: 79.0 - **ArenaHard (GPT-4-1106)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 85.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 85.0 - DeepSeek V3: 84.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 80.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 90.0 - DeepSeek R1: 91.0 #### Code Benchmarks - **LiveCodeBench (Pass@1-COT)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 - **Codeforces (Percentile)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **Codeforces (Rating)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **SWE Verified (Resolved)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 40.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 40.8 - DeepSeek V3: 40.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 38.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 50.0 - DeepSeek R1: 51.0 - **Aider-Polyglot (Acc.)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 #### Math Benchmarks - **AIME 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 16.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 16.0 - DeepSeek V3: 15.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 14.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 20.0 - DeepSeek R1: 21.0 - **MATH 500 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 23.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 23.3 - DeepSeek V3: 23.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 21.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 28.0 - DeepSeek R1: 29.0 - **CNMO 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 13.1 - GPT-4o 0513: 13.1 - DeepSeek V3: 12.8 - OpenAI o1-mini: 12.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 16.0 - DeepSeek R1: 17.0 #### Chinese Benchmarks - **CLUEWSC (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 75.6 - GPT-4o 0513: 75.6 - DeepSeek V3: 75.3 - OpenAI o1-mini: 72.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 80.0 - DeepSeek R1: 81.0 - **C-Eval (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 76.7 - GPT-4o 0513: 76.7 - DeepSeek V3: 76.4 - OpenAI o1-mini: 73.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 81.0 - DeepSeek R1: 82.0 - **C-SimpleQA (Correct)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 55.4 - GPT-4o 0513: 55.4 - DeepSeek V3: 55.1 - OpenAI o1-mini: 52.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 68.0 - DeepSeek R1: 63.7 ## Document Analysis For education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3. This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32B-Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. ## Discussion ### 4.1. Distillation vs. Reinforcement Learning In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-Rl, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale ## Page Number 14 # Pages 15 and 16 ## Table: Comparison']","OpenAI's models, particularly the o1 series, have made significant advancements in reasoning capabilities, especially through the introduction of inference-time scaling that enhances the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process.

However, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an... ## Page Number 15 ## Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate dependency evaluation within the RL process to enhance efficiency.', '<2-hop>\n\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too - We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. - Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500, and 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-source models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community. ## Summary of Evaluation Results - **Reasoning tasks**: 1. DeepSeek-R1 achieves a score of 79.8% Pass@1 on AIME 2024, slightly surpassing OpenAI-01-1217. On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%, performing on par with OpenAI-01-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. 2. On coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks, as it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in the competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than DeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks. - **Knowledge**: On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores of 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its performance is slightly below that of OpenAI-01-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1 surpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-01 surpasses 40 on this benchmark. ### Page Number 4 # Pages 5 and 6 - **Others**: DeepSeek-R1 also excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing, general question answering, editing, summarization, and more. It achieves an impressive length-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on ArenaHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks. ## Approach ### 2.1. Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.

However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an... ## Page Number 15 ## Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate dependency evaluation within the RL process to enhance efficiency.', '<2-hop>\n\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too - We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. - Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks.

Additionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500, and 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-source models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community. ## Summary of Evaluation Results - **Reasoning tasks**: 1.

Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points.

How does the cold start data improve the reasoning capabilities in RL for DeepSeek-R1 compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero?,"['<1-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.', '<2-hop>\n\ntags, respectively, i.e., `<think> reasoning process here </think>` `<answer> answer here </answer>`. User: **prompt**. Assistant: ## Table 1 | Template for DeepSeek-R1-Zero *prompt* will be replaced with the specific reasoning question during training. ## 2.2.2. Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biasessuch as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategiesto ensure that we can accurately observe the models natural progression during the RL process. ## 2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero ### Performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Figure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated, DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the RL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant increase, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels comparable to OpenAI-01-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL algorithm in optimizing the models performance over time. Table 2 provides a comparative analysis between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAIs 01-0912 models across a variety of reasoning-related benchmarks.

For each question, we sample 16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero DeepSeek-R1-Zero attains robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the models ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zeros performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks. ## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. As depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improvement. ### Page Number 7 ## Figure Description ### Title DeepSeek-R1-Zero average length per response during training ### Graph Details - **X-Axis**: Labeled as ""Steps,"" ranging from 0 to 9000. - **Y-Axis**: Labeled as ""Average length per response,"" ranging from 0 to 12000. ### Data Representation - The graph shows a line plot with a blue line representing the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero over the training steps. - The line exhibits an upward trend, indicating that the average response length increases as the']","The cold start data improves the reasoning capabilities in RL for DeepSeek-R1 by providing a small amount of high-quality data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor.

"What are the key improvements in reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning (RL) and the use of cold start data?","['<1-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2.

For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.', '<2-hop>\n\ntags, respectively, i.e., `<think> reasoning process here </think>` `<answer> answer here </answer>`. User: **prompt**. Assistant: ## Table 1 | Template for DeepSeek-R1-Zero *prompt* will be replaced with the specific reasoning question during training. ## 2.2.2. Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biasessuch as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategiesto ensure that we can accurately observe the models natural progression during the RL process. ## 2.2.4.

Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant increase, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels comparable to OpenAI-01-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL algorithm in optimizing the models performance over time.

This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the models ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zeros performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks. ## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.

However, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks.

We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biasessuch as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategiesto ensure that we can accurately observe the models natural progression during the RL process. ## 2.2.4.

Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting.

Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability.

To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks.

To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly.

For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.']","The DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model achieved a pass@1 score of 94.3 on the MATH-500 benchmark, which is significantly higher than the scores of other models listed.

However, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an... ## Page Number 15 ## Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate dependency evaluation within the RL process to enhance efficiency.', '<2-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks.

What are the key findings regarding the performance of distilled models on AIME 2024 and how do they compare to larger models like DeepSeek-R1?,"['<1-hop>\n\nof Distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCodeBench</th> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>cons@64</td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>pass@1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.6</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B</td> <td>47.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>91.6</td> <td>55.0</td> <td>40.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>72.6</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>94.3</td> <td>62.1</td> <td>57.2</td> </tr> </table> **Table 6**: Comparison of distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks. ## Text RL training, achieves performance on par with QwQ-32B-Preview. However, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an... ## Page Number 15 ## Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate dependency evaluation within the RL process to enhance efficiency.', '<2-hop>\n\nUltimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness. ## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

What are the key findings regarding the performance of distilled models on reasoning benchmarks like AIME 2024 and how do they compare to larger models like DeepSeek-R1?,"['<1-hop>\n\nof Distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCodeBench</th> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>cons@64</td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>pass@1</td> <td>pass@1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.6</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B</td> <td>47.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>91.6</td> <td>55.0</td> <td>40.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>72.6</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>94.3</td> <td>62.1</td> <td>57.2</td> </tr> </table> **Table 6**: Comparison of distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks. ## Text RL training, achieves performance on par with QwQ-32B-Preview. However, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in this paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning. ## Unsuccessful Attempts In the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along the way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that these approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models. ## Process Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better approaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Useato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate success. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second, determining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated annotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not conducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward hacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good ability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell et al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it introduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments. ## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time compute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to generate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For training, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value model. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model and the value model, iteratively refining the process. However, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First, unlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an... ## Page Number 15 ## Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work In this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start data, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful, leveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-01-1217 on a range of tasks. We further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small dense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-0wen-1.5B outperforms GPT-40 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other dense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-tuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints. In the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1. - **General Capability**: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3 in tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output. Moving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in these fields. - **Language Mixing**: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. - **Prompting Engineering**: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend users directly state the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results. - **Software Engineering Tasks**: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the efficiency of the system, DeepSeek-R1 has not been tested extensively in software engineering tasks. We observe DeepSeek-R1 has not been able to achieve the same performance as DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by enhancing rejection sampling and software engineering data to incorporate dependency evaluation within the RL process to enhance efficiency.', '<2-hop>\n\nUltimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness. ## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

"In what ways does the incorporation of cold start data in DeepSeek-R1 enhance its reasoning capabilities compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning?","['<1-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.', ""<2-hop>\n\nnumber of steps increases. - The plot includes a shaded area around the line, suggesting variability or confidence intervals in the data. ### Observations - The average response length starts at a low value near 0 and gradually increases, reaching approximately 10000 by the end of the training steps. - There is noticeable fluctuation in the response length, with some peaks and troughs, but the overall trend is upward. ### Caption Figure 3 | The average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the training set during the RL process. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally learns to solve reasoning tasks with more thinking time. This improvement is not the result of external adjustments but rather an intrinsic development within the model. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the ability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time computation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens, allowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth. One of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated behaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflectionwhere the model revisits and reevaluates its previous stepsand the exploration of alternative approaches to problem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead emerge as a result of the models interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This spontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zeros reasoning capabilities, enabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy. ## Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an aha moment. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the models growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes. This moment is not only an aha moment for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The aha moment serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. ## Page Number 8 # Pages 9 and 10 ## Text **Question**: If \\( a > 1 \\), then the sum of the real solutions of \\(\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}} = x\\) is equal to **Response**: \\<think\\> To solve the equation \\(\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}} = x\\), let's start by squaring both \\(\\ldots\\) \\[ (\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}})^2 \\implies a - \\sqrt{a + x} = x^2. \\] Rearrange to isolate the inner square root term: \\[ (a - x^2) = a + x \\quad \\implies \\quad a^2 - 2ax^2 + (x^2)^2 = a + x \\quad \\implies \\quad x^4 - 2ax^2 - x + (a^2 - a) = 0 \\] \\(\\ldots\\) **Wait, wait.

How does the cold start data in DeepSeek-R1 enhance reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero?,"['<1-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.', ""<2-hop>\n\nnumber of steps increases. - The plot includes a shaded area around the line, suggesting variability or confidence intervals in the data. ### Observations - The average response length starts at a low value near 0 and gradually increases, reaching approximately 10000 by the end of the training steps. - There is noticeable fluctuation in the response length, with some peaks and troughs, but the overall trend is upward. ### Caption Figure 3 | The average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the training set during the RL process. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally learns to solve reasoning tasks with more thinking time. This improvement is not the result of external adjustments but rather an intrinsic development within the model. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the ability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time computation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens, allowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth. One of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated behaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflectionwhere the model revisits and reevaluates its previous stepsand the exploration of alternative approaches to problem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead emerge as a result of the models interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This spontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zeros reasoning capabilities, enabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy. ## Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an aha moment. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the models growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes. This moment is not only an aha moment for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The aha moment serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. ## Page Number 8 # Pages 9 and 10 ## Text **Question**: If \\( a > 1 \\), then the sum of the real solutions of \\(\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}} = x\\) is equal to **Response**: \\<think\\> To solve the equation \\(\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}} = x\\), let's start by squaring both \\(\\ldots\\) \\[ (\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}})^2 \\implies a - \\sqrt{a + x} = x^2. \\] Rearrange to isolate the inner square root term: \\[ (a - x^2) = a + x \\quad \\implies \\quad a^2 - 2ax^2 + (x^2)^2 = a + x \\quad \\implies \\quad x^4 - 2ax^2 - x + (a^2 - a) = 0 \\] \\(\\ldots\\) **Wait, wait.

This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32B-Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. ## Discussion ### 4.1. Distillation vs. Reinforcement Learning In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-Rl, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale ## Page Number 14 # Pages 15 and 16 ## Table: Comparison']","After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base with cold start data, significant improvements in reasoning capabilities were observed, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning.

How does DeepSeek-V3-Base compare to DeepSeek-R1 in terms of reasoning capabilities and performance on benchmarks?,"['<1-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.', '<2-hop>\n\nV3: 71.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 68.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 78.0 - DeepSeek R1: 79.0 - **ArenaHard (GPT-4-1106)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 85.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 85.0 - DeepSeek V3: 84.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 80.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 90.0 - DeepSeek R1: 91.0 #### Code Benchmarks - **LiveCodeBench (Pass@1-COT)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 - **Codeforces (Percentile)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **Codeforces (Rating)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **SWE Verified (Resolved)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 40.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 40.8 - DeepSeek V3: 40.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 38.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 50.0 - DeepSeek R1: 51.0 - **Aider-Polyglot (Acc.)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 #### Math Benchmarks - **AIME 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 16.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 16.0 - DeepSeek V3: 15.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 14.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 20.0 - DeepSeek R1: 21.0 - **MATH 500 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 23.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 23.3 - DeepSeek V3: 23.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 21.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 28.0 - DeepSeek R1: 29.0 - **CNMO 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 13.1 - GPT-4o 0513: 13.1 - DeepSeek V3: 12.8 - OpenAI o1-mini: 12.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 16.0 - DeepSeek R1: 17.0 #### Chinese Benchmarks - **CLUEWSC (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 75.6 - GPT-4o 0513: 75.6 - DeepSeek V3: 75.3 - OpenAI o1-mini: 72.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 80.0 - DeepSeek R1: 81.0 - **C-Eval (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 76.7 - GPT-4o 0513: 76.7 - DeepSeek V3: 76.4 - OpenAI o1-mini: 73.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 81.0 - DeepSeek R1: 82.0 - **C-SimpleQA (Correct)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 55.4 - GPT-4o 0513: 55.4 - DeepSeek V3: 55.1 - OpenAI o1-mini: 52.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 68.0 - DeepSeek R1: 63.7 ## Document Analysis For education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3.

"How does the performance of DeepSeek-V3-Base compare to DeepSeek-R1 in reasoning tasks, and what improvements were made in the training process to enhance reasoning capabilities?","['<1-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.', '<2-hop>\n\nV3: 71.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 68.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 78.0 - DeepSeek R1: 79.0 - **ArenaHard (GPT-4-1106)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 85.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 85.0 - DeepSeek V3: 84.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 80.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 90.0 - DeepSeek R1: 91.0 #### Code Benchmarks - **LiveCodeBench (Pass@1-COT)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 - **Codeforces (Percentile)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **Codeforces (Rating)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.3 - DeepSeek V3: 50.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 59.5 - DeepSeek R1: 60.5 - **SWE Verified (Resolved)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 40.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 40.8 - DeepSeek V3: 40.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 38.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 50.0 - DeepSeek R1: 51.0 - **Aider-Polyglot (Acc.)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 50.8 - GPT-4o 0513: 50.8 - DeepSeek V3: 50.5 - OpenAI o1-mini: 47.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 60.0 - DeepSeek R1: 61.0 #### Math Benchmarks - **AIME 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 16.0 - GPT-4o 0513: 16.0 - DeepSeek V3: 15.7 - OpenAI o1-mini: 14.8 - OpenAI o1-1217: 20.0 - DeepSeek R1: 21.0 - **MATH 500 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 23.3 - GPT-4o 0513: 23.3 - DeepSeek V3: 23.0 - OpenAI o1-mini: 21.5 - OpenAI o1-1217: 28.0 - DeepSeek R1: 29.0 - **CNMO 2024 (Pass@1)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 13.1 - GPT-4o 0513: 13.1 - DeepSeek V3: 12.8 - OpenAI o1-mini: 12.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 16.0 - DeepSeek R1: 17.0 #### Chinese Benchmarks - **CLUEWSC (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 75.6 - GPT-4o 0513: 75.6 - DeepSeek V3: 75.3 - OpenAI o1-mini: 72.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 80.0 - DeepSeek R1: 81.0 - **C-Eval (EM)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 76.7 - GPT-4o 0513: 76.7 - DeepSeek V3: 76.4 - OpenAI o1-mini: 73.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 81.0 - DeepSeek R1: 82.0 - **C-SimpleQA (Correct)**: - Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022: 55.4 - GPT-4o 0513: 55.4 - DeepSeek V3: 55.1 - OpenAI o1-mini: 52.0 - OpenAI o1-1217: 68.0 - DeepSeek R1: 63.7 ## Document Analysis For education-oriented knowledge benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3. This improvement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 excels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis capabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data analysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-0 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than DeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an accuracy of over 70%. DeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a models ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion of instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL training. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard, indicating DeepSeek-R1s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its significant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale RL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse domains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an average of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. ## Page Number 13 DeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying its robustness across multiple tasks. ## Text Analysis On math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, surpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm tasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these benchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL training data currently remains very limited. ### Distilled Model Evaluation #### Table 5 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models and other comparable models on reasoning-related benchmarks. <table> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th colspan=""2"">AIME 2024</th> <th>MATH-500</th> <th>GPQA Diamond</th> <th>LiveCode Bench</th> <th>CodeForces</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>cons@64</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>pass@1</th> <th>rating</th> </tr> <tr> <td>GPT-4o-0513</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>13.4</td> <td>74.6</td> <td>49.9</td> <td>32.9</td> <td>759</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022</td> <td>10.6</td> <td>12.6</td> <td>78.3</td> <td>50.3</td> <td>38.9</td> <td>717</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenAI-01-mini</td> <td>63.6</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>53.8</td> <td>1820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>QwQ-32B-Preview</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>60.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B</td> <td>28.9</td> <td>52.7</td> <td>83.9</td> <td>33.8</td> <td>16.7</td> <td>954</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</td> <td>55.5</td> <td>83.3</td> <td>90.1</td> <td>59.1</td> <td>50.0</td> <td>1391</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B</td> <td>69.7</td> <td>87.0</td> <td>91.5</td> <td>60.4</td> <td>51.3</td> <td>1481</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B</td> <td>80.6</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>92.4</td> <td>61.5</td> <td>52.5</td> <td>1559</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B</td> <td>50.4</td> <td>80.0</td> <td>90.0</td> <td>54.5</td> <td>41.9</td> <td>1316</td> </tr> <tr> <td>DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B</td> <td>70.0</td> <td>90.4</td> <td>94.5</td> <td>65.2</td> <td>57.5</td> <td>1633</td> </tr> </table> ## Text Analysis As shown in Table 5, simply distilling DeepSeek-R1s outputs enables the efficient DeepSeek-R1-7B (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, abbreviated similarly below) to outperform non-reasoning models like GPT-4o-0513 across the board. DeepSeek-R1-14B surpasses QwQ-32B-Preview on all evaluation metrics, while DeepSeek-R1-32B and DeepSeek-R1-70B significantly exceed o1-mini on most benchmarks. These results demonstrate the strong potential of distillation. Additionally, we found that applying RL to these distilled models yields significant further gains. We believe this warrants further exploration and therefore present only the results of the simple SFT-distilled models here. ## Discussion ### 4.1. Distillation vs. Reinforcement Learning In Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-Rl, the small model can achieve impressive results. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance through the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation? To answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math, code, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. The experimental results, shown in Table 6, demonstrate that the 32B base model, after large-scale ## Page Number 14 # Pages 15 and 16 ## Table: Comparison']","DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance compared to DeepSeek-V3-Base in reasoning tasks, particularly in STEM-related questions, where significant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning.

What are the performance results of DeepSeek-R1 on AIME 2024 and how does it compare to other models in terms of reasoning capabilities?,"['<1-hop>\n\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too - We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. - Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community.

Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks. ## Approach ### 2.1. Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within `<think>` `</think>` and `<answer>` `</answer>`', '<2-hop>\n\nUltimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness. ## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within `<think>` `</think>` and `<answer>` `</answer>`', '<2-hop>\n\nUltimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness. ## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.

Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biasessuch as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategiesto ensure that we can accurately observe the models natural progression during the RL process. ## 2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero ### Performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Figure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated, DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the RL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant increase, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels comparable to OpenAI-01-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL algorithm in optimizing the models performance over time. Table 2 provides a comparative analysis between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAIs 01-0912 models across a variety of reasoning-related benchmarks.

The graph is designed to show how accuracy evolves as the model undergoes training. ### Graph Details - **X-Axis**: Represents the number of training steps, ranging from 0 to 8000. - **Y-Axis**: Represents accuracy, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0. ### Data Series 1. **r1-zero-pass@1**: - Represented by a blue line with circular markers. - Shows a gradual increase in accuracy, starting from around 0.2 and reaching approximately 0.7 by the end of the training steps. 2. **r1-zero-cons@16**: - Represented by a red line with triangular markers. - Displays a more rapid increase in accuracy, starting from around 0.2 and reaching close to 0.9 by the end of the training steps. 3. **o1-0912-pass@81**: - Represented by a dashed green line. - Indicates a constant accuracy level at approximately 0.8 throughout the training steps. 4. **o1-0912-cons@64**: - Represented by a dashed purple line. - Indicates a constant accuracy level at approximately 0.9 throughout the training steps. ### Observations - The red line (r1-zero-cons@16) shows a steeper increase in accuracy compared to the blue line (r1-zero-pass@1). - The dashed lines (o1-0912-pass@81 and o1-0912-cons@64) remain constant, serving as benchmarks or reference points for the other data series. ### Caption Figure 2 | AIME accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Zero during training. For each question, we sample 16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero DeepSeek-R1-Zero attains robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the models ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zeros performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks. ## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. As depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improvement. ### Page Number 7 ## Figure Description ### Title DeepSeek-R1-Zero average length per response during training ### Graph Details - **X-Axis**: Labeled as ""Steps,"" ranging from 0 to 9000. - **Y-Axis**: Labeled as ""Average length per response,"" ranging from 0 to 12000. ### Data Representation - The graph shows a line plot with a blue line representing the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero over the training steps. - The line exhibits an upward trend, indicating that the average response length increases as the']","The performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark shows a significant improvement, achieving a pass@1 score of 71.0%, which is competitive with OpenAI-01-0912.

What improvements were observed in the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark during the RL training process?,"['<1-hop>\n\nUltimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness. ## 2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability To equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly fine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using the 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in 2.3.3. Our findings indicate that this straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller models. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its reasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1. For distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though incorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL stage to the broader research community. ### 3. Experiment ## Benchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI, ... ## Page Number 11 In addition to standard benchmarks, we also evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we adhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we only feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we report representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and LiveCodeBench. ## Evaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as MMLU, DROP, GPOA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-evals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a zero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts are few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot may hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation protocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the HumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated using CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces dataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases, after which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench verified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related benchmarks are measured using a ""diff"" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum of 32,768 tokens for each benchmark. ## Baselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including DeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217. Since accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its performance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a). ## Evaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models. We found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in higher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we default to pass@k evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature. Specifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p value of 0.95 to generate $k$ responses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1 is then calculated as $$ \\text{pass@1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i, $$ where $p_i$ denotes the correctness of the $i$-th response. This method provides more reliable performance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang et al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64. ## Footnote 1. https://aider.chat ## Footnote `https://codeforces.com` ## Footnote https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html ## Page Number 12 # Pages 13 and 14 ### 3.1.

Reward Modeling The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards: - **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases. - **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between `<think>` and `</think>` tags. We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline. ## 2.2.3. Training Template To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides the base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template requires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biasessuch as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strategiesto ensure that we can accurately observe the models natural progression during the RL process. ## 2.2.4.

For each question, we sample 16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero DeepSeek-R1-Zero attains robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the models ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zeros performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks. ## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. As depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improvement. ### Page Number 7 ## Figure Description ### Title DeepSeek-R1-Zero average length per response during training ### Graph Details - **X-Axis**: Labeled as ""Steps,"" ranging from 0 to 9000. - **Y-Axis**: Labeled as ""Average length per response,"" ranging from 0 to 12000. ### Data Representation - The graph shows a line plot with a blue line representing the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero over the training steps. - The line exhibits an upward trend, indicating that the average response length increases as the']","During the RL training process, DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrated a significant improvement in performance on the AIME 2024 benchmark, with the average pass@1 score increasing from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%.

For each question, we sample 16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero DeepSeek-R1-Zero attains robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the models ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example, when majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zeros performance escalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-01-0912. The ability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without majority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further advancements in reasoning tasks. ## Self-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the models progression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides a clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. As depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improvement. ### Page Number 7 ## Figure Description ### Title DeepSeek-R1-Zero average length per response during training ### Graph Details - **X-Axis**: Labeled as ""Steps,"" ranging from 0 to 9000. - **Y-Axis**: Labeled as ""Average length per response,"" ranging from 0 to 12000. ### Data Representation - The graph shows a line plot with a blue line representing the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero over the training steps. - The line exhibits an upward trend, indicating that the average response length increases as the']","The performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark improved significantly during the RL training process, with the average pass@1 score increasing from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%.

"What advancements in reasoning capabilities were achieved with DeepSeek-R1 compared to DeepSeek-V3, and how does this relate to the distillation of models?","[""<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. ## Text We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. ## Page Number 3 ##"", '<2-hop>\n\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too - We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models.

Additionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500, and 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-source models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community. ## Summary of Evaluation Results - **Reasoning tasks**: 1.

While its performance is slightly below that of OpenAI-01-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1 surpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational tasks.

Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1.

Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model.

What advancements in reasoning capabilities were achieved with DeepSeek-V3 and how does DeepSeek-R1 improve upon these advancements through distillation?,"[""<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. ## Text We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. ## Page Number 3 ##"", '<2-hop>\n\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too - We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. - Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500, and 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-source models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community. ## Summary of Evaluation Results - **Reasoning tasks**: 1. DeepSeek-R1 achieves a score of 79.8% Pass@1 on AIME 2024, slightly surpassing OpenAI-01-1217. On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%, performing on par with OpenAI-01-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. 2. On coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks, as it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in the competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than DeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks. - **Knowledge**: On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-R1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores of 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its performance is slightly below that of OpenAI-01-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1 surpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where OpenAI-01 surpasses 40 on this benchmark. ### Page Number 4 # Pages 5 and 6 - **Others**: DeepSeek-R1 also excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing, general question answering, editing, summarization, and more. It achieves an impressive length-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on ArenaHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks. ## Approach ### 2.1. Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.

The aha moment serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. ## Page Number 8 # Pages 9 and 10 ## Text **Question**: If \\( a > 1 \\), then the sum of the real solutions of \\(\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}} = x\\) is equal to **Response**: \\<think\\> To solve the equation \\(\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}} = x\\), let's start by squaring both \\(\\ldots\\) \\[ (\\sqrt{a - \\sqrt{a + x}})^2 \\implies a - \\sqrt{a + x} = x^2. \\] Rearrange to isolate the inner square root term: \\[ (a - x^2) = a + x \\quad \\implies \\quad a^2 - 2ax^2 + (x^2)^2 = a + x \\quad \\implies \\quad x^4 - 2ax^2 - x + (a^2 - a) = 0 \\] \\(\\ldots\\) **Wait, wait.

This is also an aha moment for us, allowing us to witness the power and beauty of reinforcement learning. ## Drawback of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning capabilities and autonomously develops unexpected and powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces several issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability, and language mixing.

How does the cold start approach in DeepSeek-R1 improve reasoning performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero in reinforcement learning?,"['<1-hop>\n\nContributions ### Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model - We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area. - We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the models reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process.

Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within `<think>` `</think>` and `<answer>` `</answer>`', '<2-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.']","DeepSeek-R1 achieved an impressive score of 94.3% on MATH-500, significantly outperforming other models and demonstrating its strong reasoning capabilities.

In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. ## DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as evidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities **without any supervised data**, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. ## 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ### Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question $q$, GRPO samples a group of outputs $\\{o_1, o_2, \\cdots, o_C\\}$ from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ and then optimizes the policy model $\\pi_\\theta$ by maximizing the following objective: ## Formula The document contains two equations related to a mathematical model. Below is the representation of these equations using LaTeX: 1. **Equation 1:** The first equation is an expectation over a distribution, involving a summation and a minimum function. It is expressed as: $$ J_{\\text{CRPO}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[q \\sim P(Q), \\{o_i\\}_{i=1}^G \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(O|q)] $$ $$ \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^G \\left( \\min \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)} A_i, \\text{clip} \\left( \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(o_i|q)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(o_i|q)}, 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon \\right) A_i \\right) - \\beta D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) \\right) $$ 2. **Equation 2:** The second equation defines the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is a measure of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution: $$ D_{\\text{KL}} (\\pi_\\theta \\| \\pi_{\\text{ref}}) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(o|q)}{\\pi_\\theta(o|q)} - 1 $$ These equations are part of a mathematical framework, likely related to optimization or probabilistic modeling. where $\\epsilon$ and $\\beta$ are hyper-parameters, and $A_t$ is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}$ corresponding to the outputs within each group: ### Formula The formula depicted in the image is represented in LaTeX as follows: \\[ A_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\})} \\] This formula calculates the standardized value \\( A_i \\) for a given \\( r_i \\), where: - \\( r_i \\) is an individual data point. - \\( \\text{mean}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the mean of the set of data points \\(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}\\). - \\( \\text{std}(\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G\\}) \\) is the standard deviation of the same set of data points. The equation is labeled as equation (3). ## Page Number 5 ## A conversation between User and Assistant The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within `<think>` `</think>` and `<answer>` `</answer>`', '<2-hop>\n\nDeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong general capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows. ## 2.3.1. Cold Start ## Text from Document Unlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from the base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several approaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting models to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human annotators. In this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data ## Page Number 9 I\'m sorry, I can\'t assist with that. ## Readability A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable for reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to highlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1, we design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as \\|special_token\\|<reasoning_process>\\|special_token\\|<summary>, where the reasoning process is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning results. ## Potential By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we observe better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is a better way for reasoning models. ## 2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning After fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale reinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses on enhancing the models reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such as coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with clear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the models performance, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of reasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the final reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence on reasoning tasks. ## 2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning When reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which primarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the models capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we generate the data and fine-tune the model as described below. ### Reasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by performing rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage, we only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage, we expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward model by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment. Additionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have filtered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long paragraphs, and code blocks. For each prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect about 600k reasoning related training samples. I\'m unable to view or interpret images directly. If you can provide a description or transcribe the text from the document, I\'d be happy to help format it in Markdown according to your instructions. # Pages 11 and 12 ## Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition, and translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential chain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries, such as ""hello"" we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of approximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning. We fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about 800k samples. ## 2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model\'s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the learning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build upon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.']","DeepSeek-R1 improves upon DeepSeek-V3 by incorporating a cold start phase that utilizes a small amount of high-quality data to fine-tune the model before applying reinforcement learning (RL).

The profiling data was captured using the PyTorch Profiler. After downloading, you can visualize it directly by navigating to chrome://tracing in the Chrome browser (or edge://tracing in the Edge browser). Notice that we simulate an absolutely balanced MoE routing strategy for profiling. ## Training The training profile data demonstrates our overlapping strategy for a pair of individual forward and backward chunks in DualPipe. Each chunk contains 4 MoE (Mixture of Experts) layers. The parallel configuration aligns with DeepSeek-V3 pretraining settings: EP64, TP1 with 4K sequence length.

In our prefilling stage, we utilize two micro-batches to overlap computation and all-to-all communication, while ensuring that the attention computation load is balanced across the two micro-batches — meaning that the same prompt may be split between them. ### Decoding For decoding, the profile employs EP128, TP1, and a prompt length of 4K (closely matching the actual online deployment configuration), with a batch size of 128 requests per GPU. Similar to prefilling, decoding also leverages two micro-batches for overlapping computation and all-to-all communication.

After downloading, you can visualize it directly by navigating to chrome://tracing in the Chrome browser (or edge://tracing in the Edge browser). Notice that we simulate an absolutely balanced MoE routing strategy for profiling. ## Training The training profile data demonstrates our overlapping strategy for a pair of individual forward and backward chunks in DualPipe.

And the PP communication is not included during profilng for simplicity. ## Inference ### Prefilling For prefilling, the profile employs EP32 and TP1 (in line with DeepSeek V3/R1 ’s actual online deployment), with a prompt length set to 4K and a batch size of 16K tokens per GPU. In our prefilling stage, we utilize two micro-batches to overlap computation and all-to-all communication, while ensuring that the attention computation load is balanced across the two micro-batches — meaning that the same prompt may be split between them. ### Decoding For decoding, the profile employs EP128, TP1, and a prompt length of 4K (closely matching the actual online deployment configuration), with a batch size of 128 requests per GPU. Similar to prefilling, decoding also leverages two micro-batches for overlapping computation and all-to-all communication.

Notice that we simulate an absolutely balanced MoE routing strategy for profiling. ## Training The training profile data demonstrates our overlapping strategy for a pair of individual forward and backward chunks in DualPipe.

What are the key features and benefits of the Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) in AI workloads?,"[""Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB) When using expert parallelism (EP), different experts are assigned to different GPUs. Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced. As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible. To facilitate reproduction and deployment, we open-source our deployed EP load balancing algorithm in eplb.py. The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size. ### Global Load Balancing In other cases, we use the global load balancing policy that replicates the experts globally regardless of expert groups, and pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs. This policy can be adopted in decoding stage with a larger expert-parallel size. # Fire-Flyer File system The Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads. It leverages modern SSDs and RDMA networks to provide a shared storage layer that simplifies development of distributed applications. Key features and benefits of 3FS include: - Performance and Usability - Disaggregated Architecture Combines the throughput of thousands of SSDs and the network bandwidth of hundreds of storage nodes, enabling applications to access storage resource in a locality-oblivious manner. - Strong Consistency Implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) for strong consistency, making application code simple and easy to reason about. - File Interfaces Develops stateless metadata services backed by a transactional key-value store (e.g., FoundationDB). The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. - Diverse Workloads - Data Preparation Organizes outputs of data analytics pipelines into hierarchical directory structures and manages a large volume of intermediate outputs efficiently. - Dataloaders Eliminates the need for prefetching or shuffling datasets by enabling random access to training samples across compute nodes. - Checkpointing Supports high-throughput parallel checkpointing for large-scale training. - KVCache for Inference Provides a cost-effective alternative to DRAM-based caching, offering high throughput and significantly larger capacity. ## Performance 1. Peak throughput The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs. 2. GraySort We evaluated smallpond using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS. The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node).

Can you explain the role of the Expert Parallelism Load Balancer in optimizing AI workloads and how it achieves load balancing across GPUs?,"[""Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB) When using expert parallelism (EP), different experts are assigned to different GPUs. Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced. As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible. To facilitate reproduction and deployment, we open-source our deployed EP load balancing algorithm in eplb.py. The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size. ### Global Load Balancing In other cases, we use the global load balancing policy that replicates the experts globally regardless of expert groups, and pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs.

Peak throughput The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs. 2. GraySort We evaluated smallpond using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS. The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node). Sorting 110.5 TiB of data across 8,192 partitions completed in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of 3.66 TiB/min. 3. KVCache KVCache is a technique used to optimize the LLM inference process. It avoids redundant computations by caching the key and value vectors of previous tokens in the decoder layers.

Can you explain what the Fire-Flyer File System is and how it benefits AI training and inference workloads?,"[""Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB) When using expert parallelism (EP), different experts are assigned to different GPUs. Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced. As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible. To facilitate reproduction and deployment, we open-source our deployed EP load balancing algorithm in eplb.py. The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size. ### Global Load Balancing In other cases, we use the global load balancing policy that replicates the experts globally regardless of expert groups, and pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs.

What is KVCache and how it help in inference?,"[""Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB) When using expert parallelism (EP), different experts are assigned to different GPUs. Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced. As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible. To facilitate reproduction and deployment, we open-source our deployed EP load balancing algorithm in eplb.py. The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size. ### Global Load Balancing In other cases, we use the global load balancing policy that replicates the experts globally regardless of expert groups, and pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs. This policy can be adopted in decoding stage with a larger expert-parallel size. # Fire-Flyer File system The Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads. It leverages modern SSDs and RDMA networks to provide a shared storage layer that simplifies development of distributed applications. Key features and benefits of 3FS include: - Performance and Usability - Disaggregated Architecture Combines the throughput of thousands of SSDs and the network bandwidth of hundreds of storage nodes, enabling applications to access storage resource in a locality-oblivious manner. - Strong Consistency Implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) for strong consistency, making application code simple and easy to reason about. - File Interfaces Develops stateless metadata services backed by a transactional key-value store (e.g., FoundationDB). The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. - Diverse Workloads - Data Preparation Organizes outputs of data analytics pipelines into hierarchical directory structures and manages a large volume of intermediate outputs efficiently. - Dataloaders Eliminates the need for prefetching or shuffling datasets by enabling random access to training samples across compute nodes. - Checkpointing Supports high-throughput parallel checkpointing for large-scale training. - KVCache for Inference Provides a cost-effective alternative to DRAM-based caching, offering high throughput and significantly larger capacity. ## Performance 1. Peak throughput The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs. 2. GraySort We evaluated smallpond using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS. The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node). Sorting 110.5 TiB of data across 8,192 partitions completed in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of 3.66 TiB/min. 3. KVCache KVCache is a technique used to optimize the LLM inference process. It avoids redundant computations by caching the key and value vectors of previous tokens in the decoder layers. The top figure demonstrates the read throughput of all KVCache clients, highlighting both peak and average values, with peak throughput reaching up to 40 GiB/s.

Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced. As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible.

The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node.

This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC.

A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size. ### Global Load Balancing In other cases, we use the global load balancing policy that replicates the experts globally regardless of expert groups, and pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs. This policy can be adopted in decoding stage with a larger expert-parallel size. # Fire-Flyer File system The Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads. It leverages modern SSDs and RDMA networks to provide a shared storage layer that simplifies development of distributed applications. Key features and benefits of 3FS include: - Performance and Usability - Disaggregated Architecture Combines the throughput of thousands of SSDs and the network bandwidth of hundreds of storage nodes, enabling applications to access storage resource in a locality-oblivious manner. - Strong Consistency Implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) for strong consistency, making application code simple and easy to reason about. - File Interfaces Develops stateless metadata services backed by a transactional key-value store (e.g., FoundationDB). The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. - Diverse Workloads - Data Preparation Organizes outputs of data analytics pipelines into hierarchical directory structures and manages a large volume of intermediate outputs efficiently. - Dataloaders Eliminates the need for prefetching or shuffling datasets by enabling random access to training samples across compute nodes. - Checkpointing Supports high-throughput parallel checkpointing for large-scale training. - KVCache for Inference Provides a cost-effective alternative to DRAM-based caching, offering high throughput and significantly larger capacity. ## Performance 1. Peak throughput The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs. 2. GraySort We evaluated smallpond using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS. The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node). Sorting 110.5 TiB of data across 8,192 partitions completed in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of 3.66 TiB/min. 3. KVCache KVCache is a technique used to optimize the LLM inference process. It avoids redundant computations by caching the key and value vectors of previous tokens in the decoder layers. The top figure demonstrates the read throughput of all KVCache clients, highlighting both peak and average values, with peak throughput reaching up to 40 GiB/s.

How does the Expert Parallelism Load Balancer ensure load balancing across GPUs?,"[""Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB) When using expert parallelism (EP), different experts are assigned to different GPUs. Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced.

Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs.

As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible. To facilitate reproduction and deployment, we open-source our deployed EP load balancing algorithm in eplb.py. The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size. ### Global Load Balancing In other cases, we use the global load balancing policy that replicates the experts globally regardless of expert groups, and pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs. This policy can be adopted in decoding stage with a larger expert-parallel size. # Fire-Flyer File system The Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads. It leverages modern SSDs and RDMA networks to provide a shared storage layer that simplifies development of distributed applications. Key features and benefits of 3FS include: - Performance and Usability - Disaggregated Architecture Combines the throughput of thousands of SSDs and the network bandwidth of hundreds of storage nodes, enabling applications to access storage resource in a locality-oblivious manner. - Strong Consistency Implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) for strong consistency, making application code simple and easy to reason about. - File Interfaces Develops stateless metadata services backed by a transactional key-value store (e.g., FoundationDB). The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. - Diverse Workloads - Data Preparation Organizes outputs of data analytics pipelines into hierarchical directory structures and manages a large volume of intermediate outputs efficiently. - Dataloaders Eliminates the need for prefetching or shuffling datasets by enabling random access to training samples across compute nodes. - Checkpointing Supports high-throughput parallel checkpointing for large-scale training. - KVCache for Inference Provides a cost-effective alternative to DRAM-based caching, offering high throughput and significantly larger capacity. ## Performance 1. Peak throughput The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs. 2. GraySort We evaluated smallpond using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS. The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node). Sorting 110.5 TiB of data across 8,192 partitions completed in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of 3.66 TiB/min. 3. KVCache KVCache is a technique used to optimize the LLM inference process. It avoids redundant computations by caching the key and value vectors of previous tokens in the decoder layers. The top figure demonstrates the read throughput of all KVCache clients, highlighting both peak and average values, with peak throughput reaching up to 40 GiB/s.

What are the key features of the Fire-Flyer File System (3FS)?,"[""Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB) When using expert parallelism (EP), different experts are assigned to different GPUs. Because the load of different experts may vary depending on the current workload, it is important to keep the load of different GPUs balanced. As described in the DeepSeek-V3 paper, we adopt a redundant experts strategy that duplicates heavy-loaded experts. Then, we heuristically pack the duplicated experts to GPUs to ensure load balancing across different GPUs. Moreover, thanks to the group-limited expert routing used in DeepSeek-V3, we also attempt to place the experts of the same group to the same node to reduce inter-node data traffic, whenever possible. To facilitate reproduction and deployment, we open-source our deployed EP load balancing algorithm in eplb.py. The algorithm computes a balanced expert replication and placement plan based on the estimated expert loads. Note that the exact method to predict the loads of experts is out of this repo's scope. A common method is to use moving average of historical statistics. ## The Algorithm The load balancing algorithm comes with two policies used for different cases. ## Hierarchical Load Balancing When the number of server nodes divides the number of expert groups, we use the hierarchical load balancing policy to harness the group-limited expert routing. We first pack the expert groups to nodes evenly, ensuring the loads of different nodes are balanced. Then, we replicate the experts within each node. Finally, we pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs to ensure different GPUs are load-balanced. The hierarchical load balancing policy can be used in prefilling stage with a smaller expert-parallel size. ### Global Load Balancing In other cases, we use the global load balancing policy that replicates the experts globally regardless of expert groups, and pack the replicated experts to individual GPUs. This policy can be adopted in decoding stage with a larger expert-parallel size. # Fire-Flyer File system The Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads. It leverages modern SSDs and RDMA networks to provide a shared storage layer that simplifies development of distributed applications. Key features and benefits of 3FS include: - Performance and Usability - Disaggregated Architecture Combines the throughput of thousands of SSDs and the network bandwidth of hundreds of storage nodes, enabling applications to access storage resource in a locality-oblivious manner. - Strong Consistency Implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) for strong consistency, making application code simple and easy to reason about. - File Interfaces Develops stateless metadata services backed by a transactional key-value store (e.g., FoundationDB). The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. - Diverse Workloads - Data Preparation Organizes outputs of data analytics pipelines into hierarchical directory structures and manages a large volume of intermediate outputs efficiently. - Dataloaders Eliminates the need for prefetching or shuffling datasets by enabling random access to training samples across compute nodes. - Checkpointing Supports high-throughput parallel checkpointing for large-scale training. - KVCache for Inference Provides a cost-effective alternative to DRAM-based caching, offering high throughput and significantly larger capacity. ## Performance 1. Peak throughput The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs. 2. GraySort We evaluated smallpond using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS. The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node). Sorting 110.5 TiB of data across 8,192 partitions completed in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of 3.66 TiB/min. 3. KVCache KVCache is a technique used to optimize the LLM inference process. It avoids redundant computations by caching the key and value vectors of previous tokens in the decoder layers. The top figure demonstrates the read throughput of all KVCache clients, highlighting both peak and average values, with peak throughput reaching up to 40 GiB/s.

Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3.

Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4.

Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space.

DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism.

What are the main differences between Deepseek v3 and GPT-4 in terms of performance and training costs?,"['Breakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1. Underlying FLOP calculations Model Details: - Active Parameters: 37B (using FP8 precision) - FLOPs per token: Using the rule of thumb “6 FLOPs per parameter per token.” `37B×6 = 222B FLOPs per token` - Total Training Tokens: Approximately 14.8 trillion tokens - Total FLOPs required: `222 B FLOPs/token×14.8 T tokens ≈ 3.3×10²⁴ FLOPs` ### GPU FLOP Capacity (H800/H100): An H100 is roughly estimated to deliver about. 3.958×10¹⁵ FLOPs (per second or per some standardised interval — here used as a comparative metric). Ideal (Perfect Efficiency) GPU hours. (Dividing total required FLOPs by per‑GPU capability gives) `3.3×10²⁴ / 3.958×10¹⁵ \u200b≈ 8.33×10⁸ seconds⇒≈0.4 million GPU hour` Note: This “perfect efficiency” scenario is a lower bound. Real-world training is less efficient. 2. Adjusting for Real‑World Inefficiencies (Comparison with Llama 3.1) Reference Model: Llama 3.1 (405B parameters, 15 T tokens) reportedly required 30.84 M GPU hours in practice. Recalculating FLOPs for Llama 3.1: `Using the same math: 3.64×10²⁵ FLOPs required` Scaling Efficiency Using the ratio of FLOPs needed for DeepSeek‑V3 versus Llama 3.1. and assuming similar inefficiencies. The estimate adjusts to roughly 2.79M GPU hours for DeepSeek‑V3 training. 3. DeepSeek‑V3 Reported Training Breakdown According to the DeepSeek‑V3 paper Pre‑training Stage: - Per Trillion Tokens: 180K H800 GPU hours - Overall Pre‑training: Total of 2,664K GPU hours - This stage was completed in less than two months using a cluster of 2,048 H800 GPUs. Context Length Extension: - Additional 119K GPU hours Post‑training: - An extra 5K GPU hours Total GPU Hours: `2,664 K+119 K+5 K≈2.788M GPU hours` 4. Cost Estimation Assumed GPU Rental Price: $2 per GPU hour Total Rental Cost: `2.788M GPU hours×$2/hour≈$5.576 million` as stated in Deepseek paper During the pre‑training stage, training DeepSeek‑V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours… Consequently, our pre‑training stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post‑training, DeepSeek‑V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. 5.

Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3.

"What are the key differences in training efficiency and cost between Deepseek r1 and Deepseek v3, and how do these models compare in terms of architecture and performance?","['<1-hop>\n\n<source name=""https://medium.com/@visithkumarapperuma/deepseek-v3-a-game-changer-in-a-i-heres-why-it-matters-75591957ca07""> author - Visith Kumarapperuma # Deepseek V3: A Game-Changer in A.I. Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

Ideal (Perfect Efficiency) GPU hours. (Dividing total required FLOPs by per‑GPU capability gives) `3.3×10²⁴ / 3.958×10¹⁵ \u200b≈ 8.33×10⁸ seconds⇒≈0.4 million GPU hour` Note: This “perfect efficiency” scenario is a lower bound. Real-world training is less efficient. 2.

DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth.

What are the key advancements in Deepseek v3 that contribute to its efficiency and how do they compare to the training costs of similar models?,"['<1-hop>\n\n<source name=""https://medium.com/@visithkumarapperuma/deepseek-v3-a-game-changer-in-a-i-heres-why-it-matters-75591957ca07""> author - Visith Kumarapperuma # Deepseek V3: A Game-Changer in A.I. Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA).

Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

What are the key advancements in the Deepseek v3 model that contribute to its efficiency and how do they compare to the Deepseek r1 model?,"['<1-hop>\n\n<source name=""https://medium.com/@visithkumarapperuma/deepseek-v3-a-game-changer-in-a-i-heres-why-it-matters-75591957ca07""> author - Visith Kumarapperuma # Deepseek V3: A Game-Changer in A.I. Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth.

What are the key advancements in the Deepseek v3 model that contribute to its efficiency and how do they compare to the Deepseek r1 model in terms of training costs and architecture?,"['<1-hop>\n\n<source name=""https://medium.com/@visithkumarapperuma/deepseek-v3-a-game-changer-in-a-i-heres-why-it-matters-75591957ca07""> author - Visith Kumarapperuma # Deepseek V3: A Game-Changer in A.I. Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

What are the key innovations in Deepseek V3 that contribute to its efficiency and how do they compare to the training costs and architecture of other models like Llama 3.1?,"['<1-hop>\n\n<source name=""https://medium.com/@visithkumarapperuma/deepseek-v3-a-game-changer-in-a-i-heres-why-it-matters-75591957ca07""> author - Visith Kumarapperuma # Deepseek V3: A Game-Changer in A.I. Here’s Why It Matters Currently, the AI models from the Chinese startup Deepseek are causing quite a stir in the AI space. Their latest reasoning model, Deepseek r1, shows better or equal performance to competitors. But above all, they achieved it with a fraction of the training and inference cost. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on the U.S. App Store. This development has led to market concerns about A.I. investments to major U.S. tech companies. Impacting share prices of tech firms including Nvidia. ## So what made Deepseek such a big impact to A.I. ? The significance of Deepseek as a disruptor in the industry lies in its approach. Unlike other companies that pushed for better hardware, Deepseek improved the algorithms. Thus achieving better results at a software level. Note that the following details are for the Deepseek V3 model. • Deepseek said it trained a model using a data centre of some 2,000 of Nvidia H800 GPUs. • Time duration 2 months with the cost of the *final training run being ~$5.5 million This ~$5.5M reflects the “rental” cost for the GPU hours needed to train DeepSeek‑V3. It does not include: 1. The capital expenditure for owning the hardware. 2. Costs associated with prior research, ablation studies, or experiments on alternative architectures/algorithms/data. ### Deepseek made training more efficient (45 times more efficient) - Use 8-bit instead of 32-bit to save memory. - Compress key value indices which eat up a lot of VRAM; they got 93% compression ratios. - Do multi-token prediction instead of single-token prediction -> doubled inference speeds - The MOE model decomposes a big model into small models that can run on consumer-grade hardware. ## Summary of how Deepseek v3 was so efficient at training the frontier model 1. Model Architecture The model employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, where only 37B parameters fire for each token out of the total 671B. This sparse activation significantly reduces compute requirements compared to dense models. The model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This compresses the Key-Value cache, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient training. 2. FP8 Mixed Precision Training: They implemented an FP8 mixed precision training framework. Which reduces memory usage and accelerates training compared to higher precision formats. Reduced memory footprint by up to 50% compared to traditional FP16/FP32 formats. They use fine-grained quantisation strategies and increased accumulation precision to maintain accuracy. 3. Load Balancing Strategy They pioneered an auxiliary loss-free strategy for load balancing in the MoE architecture. This improved performance without the drawbacks of traditional auxiliary loss methods. 4. Training Framework They developed a custom training framework called HAI-LLM with several optimisations: DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism. This reduces pipeline bubbles and overlapping computation and communication. Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilise network bandwidth. Careful memory optimisations to avoid using costly tensor parallelism. ##', '<2-hop>\n\nBreakdown of the costs of the Deepseek v3 model Deepseek’s flagship model v3 showcases an architecture with a 671B parameter MOE (Mixture of Agents) with 37B active parameters per token - Their success stems from breakthrough engineering: using MoE architecture, implementing FP8 mixed precision training, and developing a custom HAI-LLM framework. - Deepseek excels at reasoning and math, surpassing GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. - For writing and coding tasks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintains a slight lead. - Deepseek pre-trained this model on 14.8 trillion high-quality data, taking 2,788,000 GPU hours on the Nvidia h800s cluster, costing around only $6 million - the Llama 403b was trained on 11x of that, taking 30,840,000 GPU hours, also on 15 trillion tokens. `So how true is the claim of $5.5 million, or is it another marketing trick?` 1.

What are the key improvements introduced in the V2 model compared to its predecessor?,"['Model Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","The V2 model introduced several key improvements, including a more sophisticated attention mechanism and Feed-Forward Network structure.

"Can you elaborate on the architectural advancements of DeekSeek-V3 compared to its predecessor, particularly in terms of the Multi-Head Latent Attention and the DeekSeekMoE components?","['Model Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens.

Can you explain how V2 model influenced the architecture of DeekSeek-V3 and what are the key improvements made?,"['Model Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of the model from the previous V2 model.

The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","The key components of the DeekSeek-V3 model architecture include the Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE.

How does DeepSeek's approach to training LLMs differ from traditional methods?,"['Infrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error.

When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.']","DeepSeek researchers devised innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs due to the lack of access to the NVIDIA H100.

In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.']","Due to the U.S. not exporting high-performance GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to innovate and devise methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs.

How does DeepSeek utilize the DualPipe method to enhance model training efficiency with H800 GPUs?,"['Infrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy.

How does the Chinese government affect AI model performance?,"['Reinforcement Learning After supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek additionally implemented reinforcement learning. A reward model has to be built and trained for reinforcement learning, which gives feedback to the model and determine the direction of learning.

In these domains, the specific rules are used to verify the correctness of the answers and the questions about logical reasoning are involved. However, for many questions, the answer cannot be verified by a specific rule. In those cases where no rule is provided, the model-based RM determines, whether the answer matches the ground-truth answer. Another innovative idea of DeepSeek is including the chain-of-thought to the reward, whereas conventional models only included final reward based on the answer. DeepSeek-V3 model, as V2 model did, adopted Group Relative POlicy Optimization (GRPO). This GRPO algorithm maximizes the following objective by updating the policy model π. Maximize this objective by updating the weights of the model based on the reward. Advantage is defined as the normalized reward. In LLM case, the policy model π is model itself, and θ is weights of the model. q is question and o is output of the model. We can interpret the policy model(LLM) outputs a probability distribution over tokens, where the policy π(o|q) is a probability of output o given the question q. Therefore, the policy model is LLM itself. If the output o is right answer, we should reinforce the probability of that model makes this output o. So we need to maximize π(o|q) by multiplying advantage(normalized reward). If the output o is correct, the advantage (reward) will be a positive value and the policy will be reinforced. Otherwise, it will be negative and π(o|q) should be minimized. Plus, we have a fine-tuned model as the initial base model and do not want it to go too far from this base model, which might cause model to forget basic language understanding and important knowledge that the model learned during pre-training and fine-tuning. To implement this safety concerns, GRPO algorithm used KL divergence and epsilon parameter. The KL divergence measures the difference between current policy model and reference policy model(initial base model). So the KL divergence term should be minimized to maximized the GRPO objective. And we pick minimum between the original policy and the clipped policy in (1-ε, 1+ε), by which the model cannot deviate too much from 1. So, the current policy cannot differ a lot from the old policy, restricting the effect of reinforcement learning.

How does the DeepSeek-V3 model utilize innovative techniques to enhance training efficiency and performance?,"['<1-hop>\n\nInfrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nauthor - Ataka jeong Introduction How could the DeepSeek-V3 model achieve incredible performance and economical training as an open source model?

"What innovative methods did the DeepSeek-V3 model employ to enhance training efficiency and performance, particularly in relation to the challenges posed by using weaker H800 GPUs?","['<1-hop>\n\nInfrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it.

The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error.

During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nauthor - Ataka jeong Introduction How could the DeepSeek-V3 model achieve incredible performance and economical training as an open source model?

Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nauthor - Ataka jeong Introduction How could the DeepSeek-V3 model achieve incredible performance and economical training as an open source model?

Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","DeepSeek researchers implemented several innovative methods in the DeepSeek-V3 model to enhance training efficiency, particularly in the context of using weaker H800 GPUs. One key method is the DualPipe technique, which reduces communication time between GPUs by allowing simultaneous processing of data in opposite directions. This minimizes the 'bubble' waiting time that occurs when GPUs wait for data to be copied. Additionally, they employed mixed precision training, where precision is reduced in less significant parts of the model, such as during heavy computations like matrix multiplication, while maintaining high precision for lighter computations. This approach improves both training and memory efficiency.

"What innovative methods did DeepSeek researchers implement to enhance model training efficiency with H800 GPUs, and how does the architecture of DeekSeek-V3 contribute to this?","['<1-hop>\n\nInfrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module.

Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","The DeepSeek-V3 model introduces several key innovations to enhance training efficiency, particularly through its DualPipe method and mixed precision training.

"What innovative methods did DeepSeek researchers implement in the DeekSeek-V3 model to enhance training efficiency, particularly in relation to the challenges posed by using weaker H800 GPUs?","['<1-hop>\n\nInfrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input.

Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","DeepSeek researchers implemented several innovative methods in the DeekSeek-V3 model to enhance training efficiency.

"What are the key innovations in the DeepSeek-V3 model that differentiate it from its predecessor, DeekSeek-V2, particularly in terms of architecture and training efficiency?","['<1-hop>\n\nInfrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone.

The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","DeepSeek researchers implemented several innovative methods in the DeekSeek-V3 model to enhance training efficiency and reduce communication time between GPUs.

What are the key innovations in DeepSeek-V3 that improve training efficiency compared to previous models like DeekSeek-V2?,"['<1-hop>\n\nInfrastructure 3.1 DualPipe Since the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble. During model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight. In such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure. The batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training. 3.2 Mixed precision training Mixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure. While reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted. Another issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error. These two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector.

However, its core principle still resembles that of the standard Transformer and well-known LLMs. It will be incredibly helpful to have general knowledge of previously released large language models like LLaMA. I will also add my own interpretation of the DeekSeek model in this story. Let’s dive into the new features of model architecture step by step.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","The architecture of the DeepSeek-V3 model relates to previous models like LLaMA in that it uses the structure of the ordinary transformer block, which is a common foundation for many large language models.

And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules.

"How does the DeekSeek-V3 model improve training efficiency compared to traditional methods, and what role does Multi-Head Latent Attention play in this?","['<1-hop>\n\nauthor - Ataka jeong Introduction How could the DeepSeek-V3 model achieve incredible performance and economical training as an open source model? In this paper review, we will explore the various features that were invented and applied to build the DeepSeek-V3 model. The way the paper presents the model may seem complicated to people who are unfamiliar with the new conceptualization invented by DeepSeek. However, its core principle still resembles that of the standard Transformer and well-known LLMs. It will be incredibly helpful to have general knowledge of previously released large language models like LLaMA. I will also add my own interpretation of the DeekSeek model in this story. Let’s dive into the new features of model architecture step by step.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts?

How does the DeekSeek-V3 model relate to LLaMA and what improvements does it offer in terms of model architecture?,"['<1-hop>\n\nauthor - Ataka jeong Introduction How could the DeepSeek-V3 model achieve incredible performance and economical training as an open source model? In this paper review, we will explore the various features that were invented and applied to build the DeepSeek-V3 model. The way the paper presents the model may seem complicated to people who are unfamiliar with the new conceptualization invented by DeepSeek. However, its core principle still resembles that of the standard Transformer and well-known LLMs. It will be incredibly helpful to have general knowledge of previously released large language models like LLaMA. I will also add my own interpretation of the DeekSeek model in this story. Let’s dive into the new features of model architecture step by step.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","The DeekSeek-V3 model relates to LLaMA in that it uses a similar structure based on the ordinary transformer block.

One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data. 2.2 DeekSeekMoE Secondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it. eᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in. uₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output. 2.3 Multi-Token Prediction In a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure. As shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens. In actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.']","The DeepSeek-V3 model achieves its performance through several key architectural features.

In this paper review, we will explore the various features that were invented and applied to build the DeepSeek-V3 model. The way the paper presents the model may seem complicated to people who are unfamiliar with the new conceptualization invented by DeepSeek. However, its core principle still resembles that of the standard Transformer and well-known LLMs. It will be incredibly helpful to have general knowledge of previously released large language models like LLaMA. I will also add my own interpretation of the DeekSeek model in this story. Let’s dive into the new features of model architecture step by step.', '<2-hop>\n\nModel Architecture First of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram. The two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) What is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)?

How are CSV files utilized in the 3FS system for data storage?,"['# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS.

How is etcd utilized in the 3FS system architecture?,"['# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs.

What does the term DENT refer to in the context of file metadata?,"['File metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead.

Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead.

What are the key features of 3FS in managing file metadata and chunk storage?,"['File metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures.

What is B in the context of storage targets?,"['chunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards']","B is one of the nodes in the chain replication system, where each node has 1 SSD and multiple storage targets are created on each SSD.

Wht is the role of C in the chain replication?,"['chunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design.

The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design.

Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor.

What happens when a read request arrives at a storage service?,"['the request to successor `B`. Then `B` instantly fails and the forwarded write request is lost. When cluster manager detects `B`’s failure, it marks `B` as offline and moves it to the end of chain and broadcasts the updated chain table.

When there are both committed and pending versions, the service replies a special status code to notify the client. The client may wait for a short interval and retry. Or the client can issue a relaxed read request to get the pending version. ### Failure detection The cluster manager relies on heartbeats to detect fail-stop failures. Cluster manager declares a service failed if it does not receive heartbeats from it for a configurable interval (e.g. T seconds). A service stops processing requests and exits if it cannot communicate with cluster manager for T/2 seconds. The heartbeat can be seen as a request to \\*renew a lease\\* granted by the manager. The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state.

Cluster manager declares a service failed if it does not receive heartbeats from it for a configurable interval (e.g. T seconds). A service stops processing requests and exits if it cannot communicate with cluster manager for T/2 seconds. The heartbeat can be seen as a request to \\*renew a lease\\* granted by the manager. The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state. Public state indicates if it’s ready to serve read requests and if write requests would be propagated to it. Public states are stored with chain tables and distributed to services and clients. | Public State | Read | Write | Notes | | :----------- | :--: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- | | serving | Y | Y | service alive and serving client requests | | syncing | N | Y | service alive and data recovery is in progress | | waiting | N | N | service alive and data recovery not started yet | | lastsrv | N | N | service down and it was the last serving target | | offline | N | N | service down or storage medium failure | Local state is only known by storage services and cluster manager, and it’s stored in the memory of cluster manager.

How does the cluster manager utilize the configurable interval T to detect service failures in a cloud storage system?,"['the request to successor `B`. Then `B` instantly fails and the forwarded write request is lost. When cluster manager detects `B`’s failure, it marks `B` as offline and moves it to the end of chain and broadcasts the updated chain table. Once `A` receives the latest chain table, it forwards the write request to the new successor `C`. `C` may not receive the latest chain table yet and rejects the request. But `A` can keep forwarding the request to `C`. Eventually `C` gets the latest chain table and accepts the request. When a read request arrives at a storage service: 1. When the service only has a committed version of the chunk, this version is returned to the client. 2. Unlike CRAQ, our implementation does not issue version query to the tail target. When there are both committed and pending versions, the service replies a special status code to notify the client. The client may wait for a short interval and retry. Or the client can issue a relaxed read request to get the pending version. ### Failure detection The cluster manager relies on heartbeats to detect fail-stop failures. Cluster manager declares a service failed if it does not receive heartbeats from it for a configurable interval (e.g. T seconds). A service stops processing requests and exits if it cannot communicate with cluster manager for T/2 seconds. The heartbeat can be seen as a request to \\*renew a lease\\* granted by the manager. The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state. Public state indicates if it’s ready to serve read requests and if write requests would be propagated to it. Public states are stored with chain tables and distributed to services and clients. | Public State | Read | Write | Notes | | :----------- | :--: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- | | serving | Y | Y | service alive and serving client requests | | syncing | N | Y | service alive and data recovery is in progress | | waiting | N | N | service alive and data recovery not started yet | | lastsrv | N | N | service down and it was the last serving target | | offline | N | N | service down or storage medium failure | Local state is only known by storage services and cluster manager, and it’s stored in the memory of cluster manager. If a storage target has medium failure, the related service sets the target’s local state to offline in heartbeat. If a storage service is down, storage targets managed by the service are marked offline. | Local State | Notes | | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | | up-to-date | service alive and serving client requests | | online | service alive and target in syncing or waiting state | | offline | service down or storage medium failure | A storage target can change from one public state to another in response to the latest local state. The local state plays the role of a triggering event. The cluster manager periodically scans every chain and updates the public states of targets on the chain according to a state-transition table. - The chain version is incremented if the chain is updated. - If a storage target is marked offline, it’s moved to the end of chain. - If a storage service finds public state of any local storage target is lastsrv or offline, it exits immediately. The service may be isolated from the cluster manager by network partition error. - Once the data recovery of a storage target in syncing state is completed, the storage service set the target’s local state to up-to-date in subsequent heartbeat messages sent to cluster manager. | Local State | Current Public State | Predecessor’s Public State | Next Public State | | :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- | | up-to-date | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | (any) | serving | | | waiting | (any) | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | online | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | waiting | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | offline | serving | has no predecessor | lastsrv | | | | has predecessor | offline | | | syncing | (any) | offline | | | waiting | (any) | offline | | | lastsrv | (any) | lastsrv | | | offline | (any) | offline | ### Data recovery When a storage service exits (e.g. process crashes or restarts during upgrade), or a storage medium failure occurs, all related storage targets will be marked as offline and moved to the end of chains by cluster manager.

What FUSE do?,"['Asynchronous zero-copy API Implementing the file system client as a VFS kernel module avoids performance issues mentioned above.

How does the use of SSDs in the chain replication system impact the performance during read operations and data recovery?,"['<1-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","The use of SSDs in the chain replication system significantly enhances performance during read operations by allowing multiple storage targets to be created on each SSD, which helps in distributing read traffic evenly among all targets in a chain.

Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","The use of SSDs in the chunk storage system enhances data placement and replication strategies by allowing multiple storage targets to be created on each SSD, which join different chains for efficient data distribution.

How does the use of SSDs in the chain replication architecture enhance read throughput during recovery?,"['<1-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)).

Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","The use of SSDs in the chunk storage system significantly enhances performance during data replication and recovery processes.

Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","The use of SSDs in the chunk storage system significantly enhances the performance of data replication and recovery processes in the context of CRAQ.

"How does the use of SSDs in the chunk storage system enhance read throughput during recovery, particularly in the context of the CRAQ protocol?","['<1-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata.

If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","The use of SSDs in the chain replication architecture enhances read throughput by allowing multiple storage targets to be created on each SSD, which can then join different chains.

What role does FoundationDB play in the 3FS system's metadata management and how does it ensure consistency during metadata updates?,"['<1-hop>\n\n# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS. Bandwidth of SSDs and RDMA network are not fully utilized. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)).

Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","FoundationDB serves as the distributed storage system for metadata in the 3FS system, providing a key-value store interface and supporting transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI).

"How does the use of FoundationDB as a transactional key-value store enhance the metadata management in the 3FS system, particularly in relation to the file chunk storage and dynamic file attributes?","['<1-hop>\n\n# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS. Bandwidth of SSDs and RDMA network are not fully utilized. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed.

The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","FoundationDB serves as the distributed storage system for metadata in the 3FS system, providing a key-value store interface and supporting transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI).

How does FoundationDB enhance the performance and reliability of the 3FS file system's metadata management and what role does it play in the chunk storage system?,"['<1-hop>\n\n# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS. Bandwidth of SSDs and RDMA network are not fully utilized. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes.

FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","FoundationDB supports the metadata operations in the 3FS system by providing a key-value store interface and supporting transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI).

"How does FoundationDB enhance the performance and reliability of the 3FS file system, particularly in managing file metadata and ensuring strong consistency during data operations?","['<1-hop>\n\n# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS. Bandwidth of SSDs and RDMA network are not fully utilized. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index. When creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs. When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata.

When an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path. ### File metadata on transactional key-value store 3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services. The file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the ""INOD"" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type: - All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times. - Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed. - Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward. - Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string. Directory entry keys are composed of a ""DENT"" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries. The meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions: - Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc. - Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc. For write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency. ### Dynamic file attributes On most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode. 3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients. The file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length. Due to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead. Concurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm. Our production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files. ## Chunk storage system The design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner. ### Data placement Each file']","FoundationDB supports the metadata operations in the 3FS system by providing a key-value store interface and supporting transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI).

"How does the use of FoundationDB as a transactional key-value store enhance the metadata management in the 3FS system, particularly in relation to the file chunk storage and the handling of metadata operations?","['<1-hop>\n\n# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS. Bandwidth of SSDs and RDMA network are not fully utilized. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nFile metadata store ### Location of file chunks 3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)).

The requests are executed in batches, with their sizes controlled by the `io_depth` parameter. Multiple batches are processed in parallel, whether from different rings or the same ring. However, multiple rings are still recommended for multi-threaded applications, as sharing a ring requires synchronization, which can impact performance.

"What are the performance limitations of FUSE in the 3FS system, and how does the native client address these issues with asynchronous zero-copy I/O operations?","['<1-hop>\n\n# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module.

Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time.

All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample.

What are the performance limitations of FUSE on Linux and how does the native client address these issues?,"['<1-hop>\n\n# Design Notes ## Design and implementation The 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client. All components are connected in an RDMA network (InfiniBand or RoCE). Metadata and storage services send heartbeats to cluster manager. Cluster manager handles membership changes and distributes cluster configuration to other services and clients. Multiple cluster managers are deployed and one of them is elected as the primary. Another manager is promoted as primary when the primary fails. Cluster configuration is typically stored in a reliable distributed coordination service, such as ZooKeeper or etcd. In our production environment, we use the same key-value store as file metadata to reduce dependencies. File metadata operations (e.g. open or create files/directories) are sent to metadata services, which implement the file system semantics. Metadata services are stateless, since file metadata are stored in a transactional key-value store (e.g. FoundationDB). Clients can connect to any metadata service. Each storage service manages a few local SSDs and provides a chunk store interface. The storage service implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) to ensure strong consistency. CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs. Two clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client. ## File system interfaces Object store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications. - *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one. - *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files. - *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward. ### Limitations of FUSE FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations: - *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency. - *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time. Most applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput. Read operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS. Bandwidth of SSDs and RDMA network are not fully utilized. ###', '<2-hop>\n\nAsynchronous zero-copy API Implementing the file system client as a VFS kernel module avoids performance issues mentioned above. But kernel module development is significantly more challenging than user-space system programming. Bugs are difficult to diagnose and can lead to catastrophic failures in production environments. For example, machines may crash and leave no log message for debugging. When upgrading a kernel module, all processes using the file system must be stopped cleanly; otherwise, a machine restart is required. For these reasons, we have chosen to implement a native client within the FUSE daemon. This client offers an interface that supports asynchronous zero-copy I/O operations. File meta operations are still handled by FUSE daemon (e.g. open/close/stat files). Applications call `open()` to obtain a file descriptor (fd) and register it via native API.

How does the cluster manager handle the failure of a storage target and what is the role of chain replication in maintaining data availability?,"['<1-hop>\n\nthe request to successor `B`. Then `B` instantly fails and the forwarded write request is lost. When cluster manager detects `B`’s failure, it marks `B` as offline and moves it to the end of chain and broadcasts the updated chain table. Once `A` receives the latest chain table, it forwards the write request to the new successor `C`. `C` may not receive the latest chain table yet and rejects the request. But `A` can keep forwarding the request to `C`. Eventually `C` gets the latest chain table and accepts the request. When a read request arrives at a storage service: 1. When the service only has a committed version of the chunk, this version is returned to the client. 2. Unlike CRAQ, our implementation does not issue version query to the tail target. When there are both committed and pending versions, the service replies a special status code to notify the client. The client may wait for a short interval and retry. Or the client can issue a relaxed read request to get the pending version. ### Failure detection The cluster manager relies on heartbeats to detect fail-stop failures. Cluster manager declares a service failed if it does not receive heartbeats from it for a configurable interval (e.g. T seconds). A service stops processing requests and exits if it cannot communicate with cluster manager for T/2 seconds. The heartbeat can be seen as a request to \\*renew a lease\\* granted by the manager. The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state. Public state indicates if it’s ready to serve read requests and if write requests would be propagated to it. Public states are stored with chain tables and distributed to services and clients. | Public State | Read | Write | Notes | | :----------- | :--: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- | | serving | Y | Y | service alive and serving client requests | | syncing | N | Y | service alive and data recovery is in progress | | waiting | N | N | service alive and data recovery not started yet | | lastsrv | N | N | service down and it was the last serving target | | offline | N | N | service down or storage medium failure | Local state is only known by storage services and cluster manager, and it’s stored in the memory of cluster manager. If a storage target has medium failure, the related service sets the target’s local state to offline in heartbeat. If a storage service is down, storage targets managed by the service are marked offline. | Local State | Notes | | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | | up-to-date | service alive and serving client requests | | online | service alive and target in syncing or waiting state | | offline | service down or storage medium failure | A storage target can change from one public state to another in response to the latest local state. The local state plays the role of a triggering event. The cluster manager periodically scans every chain and updates the public states of targets on the chain according to a state-transition table. - The chain version is incremented if the chain is updated. - If a storage target is marked offline, it’s moved to the end of chain. - If a storage service finds public state of any local storage target is lastsrv or offline, it exits immediately. The service may be isolated from the cluster manager by network partition error. - Once the data recovery of a storage target in syncing state is completed, the storage service set the target’s local state to up-to-date in subsequent heartbeat messages sent to cluster manager. | Local State | Current Public State | Predecessor’s Public State | Next Public State | | :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- | | up-to-date | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | (any) | serving | | | waiting | (any) | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | online | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | waiting | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | offline | serving | has no predecessor | lastsrv | | | | has predecessor | offline | | | syncing | (any) | offline | | | waiting | (any) | offline | | | lastsrv | (any) | lastsrv | | | offline | (any) | offline | ### Data recovery When a storage service exits (e.g. process crashes or restarts during upgrade), or a storage medium failure occurs, all related storage targets will be marked as offline and moved to the end of chains by cluster manager. Once the service restarts, each target on the service enters into the recovery process independently. The entire recovery process overlaps with normal activity and minimizes any interruption. When a previously offline storage service starts: 1. The service periodically pulls latest chain tables from cluster manager. But it does not send heartbeats until all its storage targets have been marked offline in the latest chain tables. This ensures all its targets would go through the data recovery process. 2. When a write request arrives during recovery, the request is always a full-chunk-replace write. The local committed version', '<2-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards']","When a storage target fails, the cluster manager detects this through heartbeats and marks the target as offline, moving it to the end of the chain.

If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`.

When there are both committed and pending versions, the service replies a special status code to notify the client. The client may wait for a short interval and retry. Or the client can issue a relaxed read request to get the pending version. ### Failure detection The cluster manager relies on heartbeats to detect fail-stop failures. Cluster manager declares a service failed if it does not receive heartbeats from it for a configurable interval (e.g. T seconds). A service stops processing requests and exits if it cannot communicate with cluster manager for T/2 seconds. The heartbeat can be seen as a request to \\*renew a lease\\* granted by the manager. The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state. Public state indicates if it’s ready to serve read requests and if write requests would be propagated to it. Public states are stored with chain tables and distributed to services and clients. | Public State | Read | Write | Notes | | :----------- | :--: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- | | serving | Y | Y | service alive and serving client requests | | syncing | N | Y | service alive and data recovery is in progress | | waiting | N | N | service alive and data recovery not started yet | | lastsrv | N | N | service down and it was the last serving target | | offline | N | N | service down or storage medium failure | Local state is only known by storage services and cluster manager, and it’s stored in the memory of cluster manager. If a storage target has medium failure, the related service sets the target’s local state to offline in heartbeat. If a storage service is down, storage targets managed by the service are marked offline. | Local State | Notes | | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | | up-to-date | service alive and serving client requests | | online | service alive and target in syncing or waiting state | | offline | service down or storage medium failure | A storage target can change from one public state to another in response to the latest local state. The local state plays the role of a triggering event. The cluster manager periodically scans every chain and updates the public states of targets on the chain according to a state-transition table. - The chain version is incremented if the chain is updated. - If a storage target is marked offline, it’s moved to the end of chain. - If a storage service finds public state of any local storage target is lastsrv or offline, it exits immediately. The service may be isolated from the cluster manager by network partition error. - Once the data recovery of a storage target in syncing state is completed, the storage service set the target’s local state to up-to-date in subsequent heartbeat messages sent to cluster manager. | Local State | Current Public State | Predecessor’s Public State | Next Public State | | :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- | | up-to-date | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | (any) | serving | | | waiting | (any) | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | online | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | waiting | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | offline | serving | has no predecessor | lastsrv | | | | has predecessor | offline | | | syncing | (any) | offline | | | waiting | (any) | offline | | | lastsrv | (any) | lastsrv | | | offline | (any) | offline | ### Data recovery When a storage service exits (e.g. process crashes or restarts during upgrade), or a storage medium failure occurs, all related storage targets will be marked as offline and moved to the end of chains by cluster manager. Once the service restarts, each target on the service enters into the recovery process independently. The entire recovery process overlaps with normal activity and minimizes any interruption. When a previously offline storage service starts: 1. The service periodically pulls latest chain tables from cluster manager. But it does not send heartbeats until all its storage targets have been marked offline in the latest chain tables. This ensures all its targets would go through the data recovery process. 2. When a write request arrives during recovery, the request is always a full-chunk-replace write. The local committed version', '<2-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ).

The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state. Public state indicates if it’s ready to serve read requests and if write requests would be propagated to it. Public states are stored with chain tables and distributed to services and clients. | Public State | Read | Write | Notes | | :----------- | :--: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- | | serving | Y | Y | service alive and serving client requests | | syncing | N | Y | service alive and data recovery is in progress | | waiting | N | N | service alive and data recovery not started yet | | lastsrv | N | N | service down and it was the last serving target | | offline | N | N | service down or storage medium failure | Local state is only known by storage services and cluster manager, and it’s stored in the memory of cluster manager. If a storage target has medium failure, the related service sets the target’s local state to offline in heartbeat. If a storage service is down, storage targets managed by the service are marked offline. | Local State | Notes | | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | | up-to-date | service alive and serving client requests | | online | service alive and target in syncing or waiting state | | offline | service down or storage medium failure | A storage target can change from one public state to another in response to the latest local state. The local state plays the role of a triggering event. The cluster manager periodically scans every chain and updates the public states of targets on the chain according to a state-transition table. - The chain version is incremented if the chain is updated. - If a storage target is marked offline, it’s moved to the end of chain. - If a storage service finds public state of any local storage target is lastsrv or offline, it exits immediately. The service may be isolated from the cluster manager by network partition error. - Once the data recovery of a storage target in syncing state is completed, the storage service set the target’s local state to up-to-date in subsequent heartbeat messages sent to cluster manager. | Local State | Current Public State | Predecessor’s Public State | Next Public State | | :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- | | up-to-date | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | (any) | serving | | | waiting | (any) | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | online | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | waiting | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | offline | serving | has no predecessor | lastsrv | | | | has predecessor | offline | | | syncing | (any) | offline | | | waiting | (any) | offline | | | lastsrv | (any) | lastsrv | | | offline | (any) | offline | ### Data recovery When a storage service exits (e.g. process crashes or restarts during upgrade), or a storage medium failure occurs, all related storage targets will be marked as offline and moved to the end of chains by cluster manager. Once the service restarts, each target on the service enters into the recovery process independently. The entire recovery process overlaps with normal activity and minimizes any interruption. When a previously offline storage service starts: 1. The service periodically pulls latest chain tables from cluster manager. But it does not send heartbeats until all its storage targets have been marked offline in the latest chain tables. This ensures all its targets would go through the data recovery process. 2. When a write request arrives during recovery, the request is always a full-chunk-replace write. The local committed version', '<2-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards']","When a storage target fails, the cluster manager detects this through heartbeats and marks the target as offline, moving it to the end of the chain.

How does the cluster manager handle the failure of storage target `B` and what steps are taken to ensure data recovery in a chain replication system?,"['<1-hop>\n\nthe request to successor `B`. Then `B` instantly fails and the forwarded write request is lost. When cluster manager detects `B`’s failure, it marks `B` as offline and moves it to the end of chain and broadcasts the updated chain table. Once `A` receives the latest chain table, it forwards the write request to the new successor `C`. `C` may not receive the latest chain table yet and rejects the request. But `A` can keep forwarding the request to `C`. Eventually `C` gets the latest chain table and accepts the request. When a read request arrives at a storage service: 1. When the service only has a committed version of the chunk, this version is returned to the client. 2. Unlike CRAQ, our implementation does not issue version query to the tail target. When there are both committed and pending versions, the service replies a special status code to notify the client. The client may wait for a short interval and retry. Or the client can issue a relaxed read request to get the pending version. ### Failure detection The cluster manager relies on heartbeats to detect fail-stop failures.

When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`.

But `A` can keep forwarding the request to `C`. Eventually `C` gets the latest chain table and accepts the request. When a read request arrives at a storage service: 1. When the service only has a committed version of the chunk, this version is returned to the client. 2. Unlike CRAQ, our implementation does not issue version query to the tail target. When there are both committed and pending versions, the service replies a special status code to notify the client. The client may wait for a short interval and retry. Or the client can issue a relaxed read request to get the pending version. ### Failure detection The cluster manager relies on heartbeats to detect fail-stop failures. Cluster manager declares a service failed if it does not receive heartbeats from it for a configurable interval (e.g. T seconds). A service stops processing requests and exits if it cannot communicate with cluster manager for T/2 seconds. The heartbeat can be seen as a request to \\*renew a lease\\* granted by the manager. The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state. Public state indicates if it’s ready to serve read requests and if write requests would be propagated to it. Public states are stored with chain tables and distributed to services and clients. | Public State | Read | Write | Notes | | :----------- | :--: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- | | serving | Y | Y | service alive and serving client requests | | syncing | N | Y | service alive and data recovery is in progress | | waiting | N | N | service alive and data recovery not started yet | | lastsrv | N | N | service down and it was the last serving target | | offline | N | N | service down or storage medium failure | Local state is only known by storage services and cluster manager, and it’s stored in the memory of cluster manager. If a storage target has medium failure, the related service sets the target’s local state to offline in heartbeat. If a storage service is down, storage targets managed by the service are marked offline. | Local State | Notes | | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | | up-to-date | service alive and serving client requests | | online | service alive and target in syncing or waiting state | | offline | service down or storage medium failure | A storage target can change from one public state to another in response to the latest local state. The local state plays the role of a triggering event. The cluster manager periodically scans every chain and updates the public states of targets on the chain according to a state-transition table. - The chain version is incremented if the chain is updated. - If a storage target is marked offline, it’s moved to the end of chain. - If a storage service finds public state of any local storage target is lastsrv or offline, it exits immediately. The service may be isolated from the cluster manager by network partition error. - Once the data recovery of a storage target in syncing state is completed, the storage service set the target’s local state to up-to-date in subsequent heartbeat messages sent to cluster manager. | Local State | Current Public State | Predecessor’s Public State | Next Public State | | :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- | | up-to-date | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | (any) | serving | | | waiting | (any) | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | online | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | waiting | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | offline | serving | has no predecessor | lastsrv | | | | has predecessor | offline | | | syncing | (any) | offline | | | waiting | (any) | offline | | | lastsrv | (any) | lastsrv | | | offline | (any) | offline | ### Data recovery When a storage service exits (e.g. process crashes or restarts during upgrade), or a storage medium failure occurs, all related storage targets will be marked as offline and moved to the end of chains by cluster manager. Once the service restarts, each target on the service enters into the recovery process independently. The entire recovery process overlaps with normal activity and minimizes any interruption. When a previously offline storage service starts: 1. The service periodically pulls latest chain tables from cluster manager. But it does not send heartbeats until all its storage targets have been marked offline in the latest chain tables. This ensures all its targets would go through the data recovery process. 2. When a write request arrives during recovery, the request is always a full-chunk-replace write. The local committed version', '<2-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design.

The metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service. Cluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states. Each storage target has a public state and a local state. Public state indicates if it’s ready to serve read requests and if write requests would be propagated to it. Public states are stored with chain tables and distributed to services and clients. | Public State | Read | Write | Notes | | :----------- | :--: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- | | serving | Y | Y | service alive and serving client requests | | syncing | N | Y | service alive and data recovery is in progress | | waiting | N | N | service alive and data recovery not started yet | | lastsrv | N | N | service down and it was the last serving target | | offline | N | N | service down or storage medium failure | Local state is only known by storage services and cluster manager, and it’s stored in the memory of cluster manager. If a storage target has medium failure, the related service sets the target’s local state to offline in heartbeat. If a storage service is down, storage targets managed by the service are marked offline. | Local State | Notes | | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | | up-to-date | service alive and serving client requests | | online | service alive and target in syncing or waiting state | | offline | service down or storage medium failure | A storage target can change from one public state to another in response to the latest local state. The local state plays the role of a triggering event. The cluster manager periodically scans every chain and updates the public states of targets on the chain according to a state-transition table. - The chain version is incremented if the chain is updated. - If a storage target is marked offline, it’s moved to the end of chain. - If a storage service finds public state of any local storage target is lastsrv or offline, it exits immediately. The service may be isolated from the cluster manager by network partition error. - Once the data recovery of a storage target in syncing state is completed, the storage service set the target’s local state to up-to-date in subsequent heartbeat messages sent to cluster manager. | Local State | Current Public State | Predecessor’s Public State | Next Public State | | :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- | | up-to-date | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | (any) | serving | | | waiting | (any) | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | online | serving | (any) | serving | | | syncing | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | waiting | serving | syncing | | | | not serving | waiting | | | lastsrv | (any) | serving | | | offline | (any) | waiting | | offline | serving | has no predecessor | lastsrv | | | | has predecessor | offline | | | syncing | (any) | offline | | | waiting | (any) | offline | | | lastsrv | (any) | lastsrv | | | offline | (any) | offline | ### Data recovery When a storage service exits (e.g. process crashes or restarts during upgrade), or a storage medium failure occurs, all related storage targets will be marked as offline and moved to the end of chains by cluster manager. Once the service restarts, each target on the service enters into the recovery process independently. The entire recovery process overlaps with normal activity and minimizes any interruption. When a previously offline storage service starts: 1. The service periodically pulls latest chain tables from cluster manager. But it does not send heartbeats until all its storage targets have been marked offline in the latest chain tables. This ensures all its targets would go through the data recovery process. 2. When a write request arrives during recovery, the request is always a full-chunk-replace write. The local committed version', '<2-hop>\n\nchunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains. Suppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `A1` | `B1` | `C1` | | 2 | 1 | `D1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `B2` | `C2` | | 4 | 1 | `D2` | `E2` | `F2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `B3` | `C3` | | 6 | 1 | `D3` | `E3` | `F3` | | 7 | 1 | `A4` | `B4` | `C4` | | 8 | 1 | `D4` | `E4` | `F4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `B5` | `C5` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | Each chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables. A few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs. Logically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table. ### Balanced traffic during recovery Suppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period. To reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic. In the following chain table, A is paired with every other SSDs. When A fails, each of the other SSDs receives 1/5 of A’s read traffic. | Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) | | :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: | | 1 | 1 | `B1` | `E1` | `F1` | | 2 | 1 | `A1` | `B2` | `D1` | | 3 | 1 | `A2` | `D2` | `F2` | | 4 | 1 | `C1` | `D3` | `E2` | | 5 | 1 | `A3` | `C2` | `F3` | | 6 | 1 | `A4` | `B3` | `E3` | | 7 | 1 | `B4` | `C3` | `F4` | | 8 | 1 | `B5` | `C4` | `E4` | | 9 | 1 | `A5` | `C5` | `D4` | | 10 | 1 | `D5` | `E5` | `F5` | To achieve maximum read throughput during recovery, the load balance problem can be formulated as a balanced incomplete block design. The optimal solution is obtained by using integer programming solver. ### Data replication CRAQ is a write-all-read-any replication protocol optimized for read-heavy workloads. Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system. When a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps: 1. The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards']","When a storage target fails, the cluster manager detects the failure through heartbeats and marks the target as offline.

The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain. 2. The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted. 3. Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target. 4. The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`. 5. If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata. 6. When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released. Suppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards']","When the cluster manager detects the failure of a storage target like `B`, it marks `B` as offline and moves it to the end of the chain, broadcasting the updated chain table. This action ensures that any write requests initially directed to `B` are redirected to the new successor, which is `C`. However, if `C` has not yet received the latest chain table, it may reject the request. The system allows `A` to keep forwarding the request to `C` until `C` receives the updated chain table and accepts the request. This process highlights the importance of the cluster manager in maintaining a global view of the chain tables and the states of storage targets, ensuring that write requests are eventually processed despite the failure of a target.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer,"[{'from': 'human', 'value': 'How does the cluster manager handle the failure of a storage target like `B` and what are the implications for write requests in a chain replication system?'}, {'from': 'gpt', 'value': 'When the cluster manager detects the failure of a storage target like `B`, it marks `B` as offline and moves it to the end of the chain, broadcasting the updated chain table.
